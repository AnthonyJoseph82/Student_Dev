As a Computer Science major with a deep-seated passion for education, I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree while exploring the infinite possibilities of coding and technology. Driven by curiosity and an innate love for problem-solving, I am navigating through this fascinating realm to make meaningful contributions in tech-education space.

In addition to academics, you'll often find me working on open-source projects - it's here where theory meets application that truly excites me! My GitHub is not just a repository of my work but also reflects my journey learning new technologies & contributing back to community!

Join me as we code our way towards better future!
